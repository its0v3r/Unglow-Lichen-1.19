# Unglow Lichen for Minecraft 1.19

## WORK IN PROGRESS
At this moment, only works server-side and with new generated chunks! Previously generated chunks will have light bugs near Glow Lichen blocks. **Only use this mod if you generated a new world!**

## What is this mod?

This is a mod that prevents Glow Lichen blocks to emit light (currently only server side and on new generated chunks).

## To be done:

- Client side version;
- Config menu to toggle mod on/off.
